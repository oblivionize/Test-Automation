# Test-Automation


    • How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      With the use of software automation you can quickly test if your code is functional. As long as your automated tests are made correctly
      you can easily test for errors as you are developing. In this project I used JUnit tests in Eclipse to automate the testing of my code.
    
    • How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      I like to immerse myself in the user's shoes and try to understand what they want out of the project from their perspective.
      By doing this I can better code and design software that really meets their requirements. Only once I have a thorough understanding
      of the requirements do I begin to work on the code. I like to take frequent input from the user throughout the development process as well.
    
    • How do I approach designing software?
      I like to follow an iterative approach to design software. I work on small segments on a time and test each segment before moving on to the next.
      This helps me find any errors in the code early when they are easy to fix. It also helps to prevent me from getting overwhelmed with large scale projects.
